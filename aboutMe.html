			<h2>Cliff Weaver - Who is he?</h2>
             <p>Who I am, what I have done and what my aspirations for the future are different but connected by a common theme - collaboration and data.</p>

            <p>Who am I? At heart I am a technologist that loves to create innovative business solutions in a collaborative environment with bright enthusiastic 
                peers. I want to move fast to capitalize on opportunities. I eschew wasteful policies and procedures in favor of experimentation, execution and 
                progress. I want to move the ball forward every day.</p>

            <p>What have I done? A lot in different industries. The purpose was always the same - to make the business better and develop those around me to 
                grow and succeed. I have deep technology knowledge in all aspects of enterprise architecture, app development, and emerging IT trends 
                while rationalizing business requirements and correlating for optimum investment value.</p>
            <p>I have supplemented my work experience by continuing education - I am a lifetime learner. While my formal education covers engineering, 
                business and law, my certifications highlight my varied interests including project and product management, many IT certifications, SCRUM, 
                and statistics and machine learning.</p>
            <p>What are my aspirations? I want to capitalize on all of my skills to drive significant business growth quickly using business acumen, 
                leadership and a passion for data science. Data science - a skill set that combines, computer science, statistics, operations research, 
                engineering, business insights and strategy and the impact it can have on a business - defines what I have done, what I study and where 
                I want to complete my working life. I would like to start or join an existing team to build a learning organization driven by data in an 
                environment that is resultsâ€“driven that understands the difference between activity and results.</p>
            <p><bold>Ready to move fast? I am.</bold> </p>

           <p>I mentioned that I am lifetime learner.  If you are interested in the <bold>30+ courses</bold> I have taken in the last couple of years, 
               take a <a href="courseList.html" class="logo"><bold>look</bold></a>.</p>

            <p>Feel free to take a look at my resume.  I have two.  One is traditional.  Because I have been worknig for more years than I wish to remember, my 
            passion and dedication to data gets loss in the experience.  Therefore, I also provide a link to a PDF that focuses on data science and machine learning.<br>
            Perhaps I can help you?</p>
