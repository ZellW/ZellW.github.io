			<h2>What is the meaning of the website name?</h2>
                      	<p>Why is this website called R Is My Hammer?  Simple really.  There is a colloquialism called Maslow's Hammer:  <em>When you are a hammer, 
			everything looks like a nail. </em> Through the years, this has morphed into several versions:</p>
                      	<ol>     
                        <li>To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.</li>
                        <li>If your only tool is a hammer then every problem looks like a nail.</li>
                        <li>Give a young boy a hammer, and he will treat everything as a nail.<b></b><i></i><u></u></li>
                      </ol>
                      <p>No one is certain of the <a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/05/08/hammer-nail/">origins </a>of these sayings.</P

			<p>In my case, I use R for everything in data science.  It was the tool I selected from the beginning.  OK, I did not really choose it.  The first data science certification course I took was 
			the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science">Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization Certification </a>hosted on Coursera.  
			One of the first courses of 10 was an introduction to R.  Since then, I have programmed nearly everyday using R.  R is the only tool I use.  R provides 
			all the tools to collect and tidy data, to perform statistical analysis and create machine learning algorithms and lastly provide a rich environment to develop 
			reproducible research and interactive visualizations.  At work I often comment to developers I can perform the same task faster and with much fewer lines of code.  
			If it is data related, R is an excellent choice.  Are there other data science tools?  Of course there are.  The primary alternative to R is Python.  I'll save 
			that discussion for a later entry.</p>
							
                      <h2>Why do I have this website?</h2>
			<p>There are two primary reasons I have this website:</p>			
                      <ol>
                        <li>I want to spread the love for R.  If I am an R enthusiast, I want others to join me.  (And we number in the millions.)</li>
                        <li>Change the trajectory of my career.</li>
                      </ol>
                      I think by now you know I love the R language.  It fits my needs and aspirations perfectly.  It can do anything required in the 
			field of data science.  (If you disagree, let me know.  I love a spirited discourse.  I'll setup a wiki for this and other discussions.)
                      While I have decades of experience using data to drive decisions, I have not been formally titled as a BI Specialist, a data analyst, or a data scientist.  
			I could argue that I have always performed these functions honestly but that does not get me a role as a data scientists.  I have been a product manager, 
			program manager, VP, Director IT and others.  However, none of this impresses employers or provides evidence of my skills and interests.
                      So, to help promote the skills I do have, I plan to begin publishing my R code and related articles to prove I have the skills - and desire - to modify 
			my future so that I can live in R, develop innovative machine learning algorithms and help change the world.  I hope you will join me on this journey.
