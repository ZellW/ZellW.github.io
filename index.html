										<h1>Hi, I’m an R enthusiast<br />
										</h1>
										<p>Exploring, R, data science & machine learning</p>
										</header>
										<p>I have been passionate about data-driven decision-making (D3M) for decades. It was - and still is - challenging to introduce data-driven 
											decisions in organizations. Sometimes the maintenance of the status quo is too strong to change. Other times the company that 
											is making money is not interested in changing to avoid upsetting Wall Street. I submit that avoiding D3M is a short-term outlook 
											ignoring the long-term strategic benefits that not only grows the organization but also protects it from current and future competitors. 
											Organizations that do not fully embrace data as a strategic advantage are doomed to fail. It is just a question of when. 
											This website was born from both frustration and hope. Frustrated that we are often to blind to see reality and hopeful that we adopt 
											data as a strategic asset that must be leveraged to its fullest. How do I attempt to demonstrate the value of data? Simple, I create 
											demos using R to create machine learning alorithms to show what is possible. I use R for everything - it is my <a href="why2.html">hammer</a>.</p>

											<br>
											<h2>What Have I been Up to Lately?</h2>
	
											<p>It has been quite a while since I added any content to this website. For those that visit, I apologize.  <i>Don't think for a minute that my
												passion for R has waned - it has only amplified.</i> </p>
										
											<p>I have dedicated significant time developing Shiny applications. Creating algorithms and solving business problems still drive me, but I also must avoid common pitfalls
												in data science.  Nearly every company that starts a data sicence discipline is disappointed shortly thereafter. The instant business improvements envisioned often never materialize
												or take so long to produce, the company has moved onto other priorities. I have witnessed this time and time again. (In fact, it is these professional opportunties I enjoy today and will
												for the rest of my professional life.) 				
											</p>
											
											<p>There are ways to practice data science in a widly successful manner in any business.  It really is not that hard, but discipline and a bit of experience is needed.  One of the 3 things 
												minimally required is producing results in an iterative manner and socializing the output. Your customers, whether they be internal or external to the company, must interact with 
												your work. If your customer is engaged and knows progress is being made, your project will contiue to be supported. Shiny applications, writtten in R (and perhaps a bit of Python 
												too if that's your hammer) produce dashboards and applications Tableua only dreams about. This is what I have been focused
												on.  Docker, APIs, Cloud technologies hosting <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/">Flexdashboards</a> and Shiny Applications is my current R passion.
											</p>
											
											<p>Take a look at my <a href="https://shiny.cliffweaver.com/">application library</a>.  Even the home page is written in 100% R.  This is a skill all data science practitioners must develop.</p>

												<h3>What is R?</h3>
												<p>The Second Machine Age is coming to life through the explosive growth of data science and machine learning. 
													How do many of these technologies get built? It is simple. A powerful computer programming language called R 
													provides the statistical, data munging, visualization and machine learning capabilities driving many of these 
													technology advancements.  <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/201141096-Getting-Started-with-R">Start learning R.</a></p>

												<h3>What is Data Science?</h3>
												<p>Data Science is an interdisciplinary field about processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various 
													forms, either structured or unstructured, which is a continuation of some of the data analysis fields such as statistics, 
													data mining., and predictive analytics. Data science has become a fourth approach to scientific discovery, in addition to 
													experimentation,  modeling, and computation</p>

												<h3>What is Machine Learning?</h3>
												<p>Machine learning is a field of science that focusses on mathematically describing patterns in data.  It is a skill set that combines 
													computer science, statistics, operations research, engineering, business insights and strategy — and the impact it can have on a business. </p>

												<h3>What is Deep Learning (Neural Nets)?</h3>
												<p>Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.  
													Please, do yourself a favor and take a minute to know the <a href="http://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-deep-learning/" target="_blank">difference</a> between 
													deep learning, machine learning and AI.  While the general public uses the terms interchangeable does not mean you should!

												<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
												<p>A learning method must have low variance and low bias.  Variance is the error amount that changes when used with a different training set.  
													The more flexible the method, the higher the variance.  Bias is the error introduced by approximating a real life problem by a simpler model.  
													More flexible models result in less bias. </p>

												<h3>Learning Methods</h3>
												<p>Supervised learning builds a model for predicting or estimating an output based on one or more inputs.
													Unsupervised learning involves inputs but no supervising outputs – learn relationships and structure of data.  
													(The model lacks the response variable that can supervise the analysis.)</p>
