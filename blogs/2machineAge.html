    by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee.  It might change your life.</p?

<p>The authors argue that big data, computation and innovation are changing our economy and institutions with a magnitude greater 
    than almost anything ever seen in history - we’ve entered the second machine age.</p>

<p>To understand the importance of this new age of data and computation, they offer a comparison to a prior historical time period: 
    the first machine age.</p>

<p>For many thousands of years, humanity was a very gradual upward trajectory. Progress was achingly slow, almost invisible.  
    Then in the late 1700's, the steam revolution began creating the biggest and fastest transformation in the entire history of the world.  
    It allowed us to overcome the limitations of muscle power, human and animal, and generate massive amounts of useful energy at will. 
    This led to factories and mass production, to railways and mass transportation. The Industrial Revolution ushered in humanity’s 
    first machine age—the first time our progress was driven primarily by technological innovation.</p>

<p>We’ve now entered a second machine age: an age defined by computational technologies instead of mechanical ones. Brynjolfsson  
    and McAfee propose that as the steam engine transformed our ability to do physical work, computers, digital technology and 
    AI will transform our ability to do mental work.  As the first machine age enabled humans to overcome their physical limitations, 
    the second machine age will help humans overcome their mental limitations.</p>

<blockquote><em>Computers and other digital advances are doing for mental power … what the steam engine and its descendants did 
    for muscle power.</em></blockquote>
